# Prometheus and Grafana Kubernetes manifests

This is a repo of Kubernetes manifests to install Prometheus and Grafana on a k3s Kubernetes cluster.

This is configured for my home server that has a Logical Volume mounted at `/mnt/storage`.

An Ingress is defined for my custom subdomains as well.

These manifests were created based on these posts.
